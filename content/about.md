Hey, *Keivan Shah* here. A curious engineer trying to make his living working as a Software Developer! Currently I am working as a [HFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading) Developer @ [slf.ai](https://slf.ai/)

Thanks for stopping by my website! Currently I am not sure what I intend to do with this website but hopefully I will figure it out someday :D
